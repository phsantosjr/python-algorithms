Some algorithms examples and exercises using Python


### List of Algorithms ####

- Sum
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Palindrome [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome]
- Factorial [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial]
- Tower of Hanoi [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi]

In python file you will find more than one version for the same algorithm. That's to show how can we improve performance for our codes.

### BIG-O Notation ####

|Name | BIG O |
|---|---|
|Constant | O(c) |
|Linear | O(n) |
|Quadratic | O(n^2) |
|Cubic | O(n^3) |
|Exponential | O(2^n) |
|Logarithmic | O(log(n)) |
|Log Linear | O(nlog(n)) |

#### Constant Complexity ( O(c)) ####

The complexity of an algorithm is said be constant if the steps required to complete the execution of an algorithm remain constant.

```sum_numbers()```

#### Linear Complexity ( O(n)) ####


#### Quadratic Complexity ( O(n^2)) ####


#### Cubic Complexity ( O(n^2)) ####
